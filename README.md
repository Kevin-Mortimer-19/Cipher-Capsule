# Cipher-Capsule

The inner workings of the American encryption machine SIGABA was kept a secret until the early 2000’s. The Cipher Capsule project aims to provide a 3D visual educational experience for users to learn about the SIGABA machine and how it was used to keep the country's most secret messages from being decrypted. Cipher Capsule allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by using a user-friendly 3D simulator of the SIGABA machine. Users can also learn about the machine’s history and the fundamental concepts of encryption while using the simulation.
